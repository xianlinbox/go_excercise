# Golang key point

## Package

- executable package: build out an executable, and must have a main func.

- reusable package:

## Data types

bool, string, int, float, byte

Array, Slice

structï¼š

## Philosiphy

- Go lang has no class, not OO approach, we need to define new type and apply func to the new type as a receiver, like: func ({type}) name(){}
